![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb31cbfb-863f-4900-88a5-249b2b406109)
This project focuses on predicting early signs of suicidal tendencies using Excel-based data analysis. The analysis is built around key psychological, academic, and social indicators to help identify individuals who may be at risk of suicide, enabling timely intervention and support.

## üìå Objective

To analyze structured data on personal and psychological attributes using Microsoft Excel to:
- Identify patterns associated with suicide attempts
- Highlight individuals at potential risk
- Provide insights through visual dashboards and data summaries

## üìä Dataset Description

The dataset is stored in an Excel workbook and includes the following columns:

- **Age**
- **Gender**
- **Stress Level**
- **Academic Performance**
- **Health Condition**
- **Relationship Condition**
- **Family Problem**
- **Depression Level**
- **Anxiety Level**
- **Mental Support**
- **Self-Harm Story**
- **Suicide Attempt** *(Target Variable)*

Each of these features is numerically or categorically encoded to support filtering, conditional formatting, and pivot analysis.

## üìÅ Project Structure

## üìä Result/Findings

-As stress level rise the likelihood of sucidal thougth and attempts increases
 there is a positive correlation between stress level and suicide attempt
-Females tend to show signs of depression slighltly earlier in age compared to males
-Poor academic performance (often or sometimes) show higest depression level
 Those with excellent or good result report low depression level (Academic performace significantly impacts mental health)
-Mental support is highest among those in a relationship, regardless of family problems.
  Individuals with parental conflict and in a breakup situation receive the least mental support.
  Breakups and family issues (especially parental conflict) are associated with lower mental support.
  Relationship condition and family environment play a major role in available mental health support.
-Individuals with a self-harm history ("Yes") have a much higher rate of suicide attempts than those without.
There is a strong positive relationship between self-harm history and suicide attempts. Prior self-harm is a significant indicator of elevated suicide risk.
